                I had been thinking about this idea while in my Essentials of Entrepreneurship class and developed the idea
                a little more in my Entrepreneurship seminar. The idea is a hybrid of Apple's Screen Time and OneSec which
                both aim to increase resistance to addictive phone applications. Their solutions alone were not good enough
                in my opinion, but a merging of their solutions in addition to my own flavor would tremendously increase the
                resistance and successfully aid in combatting addiction.

                I made this as a project for my mom. I had just recently learned JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in my Spring CSE
                110 Software Enginnering class so I thought I could showcase my family the skills I had been learning while
                also experimenting with the tools I just learned.

            <p>
                I wanted to explore in several fields in Computer Science, and Cybersecurity was one of them. I decided to
                make a keylogger as it would be a relatively simple project. This would also be the first time I motivated
                myself to make a project solely on my internal motivation. I followed a tutorial, but attempted to create it
                beforehand using only the Win32 API.
